    <h5>Annelise, posed with her trophy after a winning a drag race category in 2019</h5>
    <p>Annelise is one of the very few, probably only two right now, female drag racers in the Federation of St. Kitts and Nevis.</p>
    <p>In about 2005/6 she imported from Japan a Honda Prelude. The first ever drag race event at the St. James Race Way on Nevis was held in September 2008.</p>
    <p>She intended to race that day, just to see what time it would run. When she showed up at the gate,</p>
    <p> the surprised gate keeper said he was not aware that women race.</p>
    <p>Well, she did and won her first ever event, at the inaugural Drag Race meet, and nobody was more surprised than she was.</p>
    <p>For the following 8 years, she regularly took part with the Honda Prelude, upgrading it as time went by and regularly winning the 13 second class over 1000ft.</p>
    <p>The car was consistent at 13.1 and 13 flat so it was really difficult to beat. On top of that, she has mad reaction times that would often leave her competition at
    <p>the line having to play catch up. Over the years, she's accumulated quite a fan base, people would often stop her in town after another win and congratulate her</p>
    <p>or enquire about some drag racing event. In 2017 she decided to sell the Prelude and imported a little Toyota Vitz RS which was a really fun and zippy car to drive.</p>
    <p>It wasn't fast enough though, so she decided to turbo charge it and Akeem Walters <a href="https://www.facebook.com/apautoservices">(of A+ Auto Services)</a> from St. Kitts undertook this very involved project.</p>
    <p> From that little project, she says she's learnt quite a lot. The actual installation and manufacturing took about 6 months, and they were just getting there -</p>
    <p>getting some good racing times without the use of slicks, sorting out little niggles after the turbo installations - when disaster struck.</p>
    <p>In August 2019, she was involved in a vehicle accident and crashed the car. No, she was not speeding or driving recklessly, but that was the fate of the car.</p>
    <p>It was also her daily drive, too, but it was beyond repair. So, in February 2020, she imported a Mitsubishi Evolution 7 (which she's named Shichi),
    <p>but to date she's not been able to put the car through her paces on the track, mainly due to Covid 19, so she's not sure yet
    <p>if Shichi will be race-worthy or not. (We think she will be of course... She's an Evo.)</p>
    <p> Anne says she has a specific time in mind for her, but she needs to be able to do that without major upgrades. Only time will tell.</p>

    <h3>Annelise's Shichi</h3>
    
    <p> Off the track, Annelise is actually from South Africa but has lived and worked on Nevis For 22 years.</p>
    <p>She's a pastry chef by trade and she likes to play dominos in her free time.</p>
    <p> She also loves to swim. But not do both at the same time. She annually participates in the Cross Channel Swim (alas, not this year)</p>
    <p>and loves to play mas regularly and always joins a troupe for parade day.</p>
    <p>Before coming to live on Nevis, Anne had never raced. She says she hopes that we will be able to have competitive drag racing soon again.</p>
    <p>Remember that Prelude we spoke about? Here's one of her early races:</p>
